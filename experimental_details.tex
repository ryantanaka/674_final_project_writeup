\subsection*{Parameter Sweep Application and Infrastructure}
A parameter sweep application containing 50 files and 50 tasks is randomly
generated. Connections between files and tasks are random. File sizes range from
1 to 1000 megabytes and task computation requirements range from 1 to 1000 flops.

The master worker infrastructure containing 10 workers is also randomly
generated. Each worker has a compute speed ranging from 1 to 1000 flops per second
and the link between the master and each worker ranges from 1 to 1000 megabytes
per second.

When executing the genetic algorithm and both heuristics, the same parameter
sweep application and master worker infrastructure is used. The scheduling
logic for both the genetic algorithm and the heuristics is implemented in C++
using the WRENCH API.

\subsection*{Genetic Algorithm}
The genetic algorithm itself is implemented in Python and bindings to C++
were developed such that the genetic algorithm may pass individuals into the
WRENCH simulation for fitness evaluation.
